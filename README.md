# MMPostcodeTextField
UK postcodes are particularly hard to enter on an iOS keyboard because of the alternating letters and digits.

This gem assists users to type a UK postcode by showing when it's valid, automatically selecting the correct keyboard-type, and placing the space between it's two parts.  It includes a sample Xcode project.  The `src` directory contains all the files you need when using this in your own project.
